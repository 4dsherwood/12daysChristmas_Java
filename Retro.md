session 0 = ~working agreement
tabletop role playing
rather than session 1
you have session 0 to levelset    to make sure everyone has a comfortable space in the space

Get out of this session
1. [X] joy of collab
2. [X] new ways to look at the problem
1. [x] inside out (classical TDD ?London school?)
do the small things first, craft each of the individual blocks AND THEN
build a structure from the blocks
  [x] outside in (mockish approach ?chicago school?)
build a function then refactor to use the newly created function 
Build the exterior before building the interior

2. [ x] smallest parts that we think we will make work

4. [ x] approach like this
        I would like to write a test for day one and then a test for day 2, and then a test that refactor the word first and second so that we can pass the word as a parameter, as an interger.

DUP licate  like DUPE 

it has been nice and chill
a lot of small laughs and giggles
a good sign of good chemisty
I feel more energy at end

so good at faciltating
